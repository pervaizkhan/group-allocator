This directory should contain the following files

ORSNZ.cls - modification of standard article.cls
ORSNZ.sty - simple modification of achicago.sty to work with ORSNZ.cls

It is best not to change the name of these two.

ORSNZ.tex - sample conference submission. Uses ORSNZ.sty and .cls.
ORSNZ.bib - sample bibliography

One can change the names of these two without problems, provided references to them are adjusted correctly.

frankenstein - directory available from CTAN containing achicago package. 
The BiBTeX style file achicago.bst must be made available to BiBTeX. 
Several other files are used by ORSNZ.sty, so best is to install the 
entire frankenstein package as explained in the file INSTALL.
